## 📑 Contents

The notebook walks through the **core methods of health economic evaluation**:

1. **Introduction & Setup**  
   - Loading libraries and generating example cost/effectiveness data.  

2. **Cost-Effectiveness Basics (ICER & CE Plane)**  
   - Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER).  
   - Cost‑Effectiveness Plane visualization.  

3. **Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**  
   - Utilities × life years to capture both quality and length of life.  

4. **Decision Trees**  
   - Short‑term model for competing strategies.  

5. **Markov Models**  
   - State‑transition models for chronic disease progression.  

6. **Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis (PSA)**  
   - CEAC (Cost‑Effectiveness Acceptability Curve).  
   - EVPI (Expected Value of Perfect Information).  

7. **Budget Impact Analysis (BIA)**  
   - Multi‑year projection of adoption costs.  

8. **Survival & Outcomes Modeling**  
   - Kaplan–Meier survival and parametric extrapolation.  
   - QALY derivation from survival.  

9. **Discussion & Policy Implications**  
   - Decision thresholds, uncertainty, budget impact, and equity.
